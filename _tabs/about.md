# What is Epphilo?

Epphilo is an association of EPFL students for philosophy. We organize various events at EPFL that are open to everyone, including conferences, "mat√© philo" (discussions between students on philosophical subjects), and "joutes oratoires" (debating contests).

Please join us at our next event!
