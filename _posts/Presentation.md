# What is EPPHILO ?

Epphilo is a Philosophy association based in EPFL (Ã‰cole Polytechnique de Lausanne)
It's main objective is to promote thinking on campus and to promote the relations between science and philosophy. 

We strongly believe that in order to have a real understanding and a real impact in your field, you need to understand why you are studying and what could be the implications of your discoveries, hence the philosophy. 
Philosophy, traditionally, is trying to answer profound questions with abstract thinking and logical arguments. You may think that since the fields are really specialized, philosophy is not relevant to help in the scientific research, and in a way it is true that it will not give you a protocole for your next experiment. 
But, it's logical arguments, its perspective on how you should organize and categorize your ideas and even some thinking about our nature is still really relevant as we will try to prove it. 
And it is not for nothing that Aristotle is considered to be the father of modern medecine, his methods are still today the basis of how we desing experiments.
